# Frontend Mentor - Notifications Page
A user interface component designed to display and manage notifications for users. It provides a visual representation of unread and read notifications, allowing users to easily track and interact with their notifications.

[Live Demo](https://rogeliocamargo.github.io/notifications-page/)

## Features
- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications: Users should be able to differentiate between unread and read notifications through visual cues or indicators. Unread notifications should stand out to draw attention.
- Mark all as read: Implement functionality that allows users to mark all notifications as read. This action should toggle the visual state of unread notifications and set the count of unread messages to zero.
- View optimal layout for different devices: Ensure the notifications page is responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience on various screen sizes. Consider using responsive design techniques and media queries to adapt the layout accordingly.
- Hover and focus states: Provide appropriate hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page to enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback when interacting with the notifications.

## Technologies
- HTML5: Markup language for structuring the page content.
- CSS3: Styling language for designing the page layout and visual appearance.
- JavaScript: Programming language for implementing interactivity and dynamic behavior.
